    <p>
        Happy 2-year anniversary! Words can't express how beautiful these 
        two years have been with you my love. All my days have been filled with love, 
        laughter and endless memories with you. I refuse to believe I am anything but the 
        luckiest man on the planet to have found you when I did. You're my rock, my joy and
        you inspire me to be the best version of myself. I cherish our love that grows 
        stronger each day I spend with you. Here's to us and
        many more amazing years ahead with you. I choose you today, tomorrow and every
        day after. I love you the most, forever and always.

    </p>
