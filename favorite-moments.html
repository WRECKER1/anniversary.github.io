            <h2>My Favorite Moments From This Year</h2>
        </a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Every moment feels like a dream when you're with me but some days are more 
            special than others. This is my attempt at recollecting my favorite memories
            and moments from this year that I will always cherish:
            <br>
            <br>
            Making a discord server together: Yes, I know it's cringe but the idea of owning something together
            other than Minecraft homes seemed appealing. You were so happy when I made the server 
            and now it's become a part of our daily lives. It's like a fourth family member after Natsu.
            <br>
            <br>
            Playing and finishing It Takes Two: We have played and finished so many games 
            together but It Takes Two has a special place in our hearts. I got to know you 
            so much more through that game. It made me realize what a sore loser you are
            and how I should let you win(probably all the time). Since it takes a while to finish 
            the game, we have had fights and arguments during our playthroughs and it's 
            a great example of how nothing can come between us. And yeah snowball fights. I loved 
            those in It Takes Two. Some other games would be PICO Park that we played with Gabby 
            that was really fun. Regardless, no matter what we are playing, I love it as long 
            as it's with you.
            <br>
            <br>
            After we had a big fight: This sounds weird but don't be shocked. By this I meant 
            after we got back together which was like 2 hours after we broke up xD. We have had 
            plenty of issues like every relationship but when we got back together, it seemed 
            to me like you were finally ready to trust me with yourself. You were understanding and I 
            learned to open up to you more thereafter and it made us stronger. I know it is one of 
            your more disliked experiences but I had never felt so special before you started listening 
            to me and paying attention to me. They say love is perfect but I think love is how hard 
            we are willing to work for it and now that you trust me with your heart, I promise to take 
            good care of it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since I have had so little time to make this, my overworked brain can't come up with 
            more but if we do come up with any other super special occassions, I can add it anytime.
            I enjoyed every game I played with you, every movie, anime and TV series I watched with you
            and every waking moment of my life that I spent talking to you. You are my everything 
            and the time I have spent with you has been the best time of my life.
