            <h2>You're cute!!</h2>
        </a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Yeah you heard me right. I know you're probably tired of hearing this every conversation 
            but today I get to appreciate you a little more than the regular "you're cute!". 
            <br><br>
            You ask me why I love you like almost everyday. Well here's your chance to fully 
            understand why.
            <br><br>
            Let me start with your voice. I'll try to keep this part PG-13 but you have the nicest 
            voice I have ever heard. Other than the fact that you can switch up your voice in a 
            second and seem likea completely different person is both delightful and terrifying
            at the same time. But yeah, before I get too into it, cute voice! But a voice isn't all.
            It's how you use it.
            <br><br>
            You know all the right things to say. This is something I don't often say but when I do 
            I mean it with my heart. You cheer me up in my darkest of despairs and you make every 
            enjoyable moment ten times more so. Your laugh is simply perfect and your giggle lights
            up my day like nothing else. Your voice keeps me rooted and everything you say to me 
            makes a profound impact to me even if it's the stupidest thing I have ever heard. I have 
            learned to take the things you say seriously and everything you ever tell me carries a 
            heavy weight in my mind. I have a big responsibility not just as the listener but also as 
            the person who you have chosen to give your heart and your voice to. And I promise to 
            uphold the level of attention and care that you give me without asking for anything in 
            return.

            I like how we are nothing alike and yet can almost read each other's minds. Yesterday I 
            realized how we talk exactly how we want each other to talk even though the topics 
            we converse about in our daily lives are nothing alike. I bet you never have to talk about 
            finances, economy, coding etc and I never talk about Roblox, Art or some friends circle 
            drama and yet when we are together, we are the same person, speaking the same language.
            With a foundation as strong as ours, there is nothing we can't face in life with some 
            good communication and lots of love and I hope you feel the same way too.
            <br><br>
            I have called you smart before but I have never really elaborated why. You see, there's 
            categories that I put everyone into when I meet them. And you are what I would call street 
            smart. Once you come across something that you can solve, it's always etched in your brain.
            Street smartness is but the ability to use these experiences in unfamiliar situations to get 
            satisfying results. Your skill in survival games and other minigames, your smarts while 
            solving stupid problems and questions is amazing even thought you don't see it so. Over the 
            two years I have been with you, you have gone from being utterly depressed to someone 
            who looks forward to things and has goals and aspirations. As a partner, I am so excited 
            to see what your future holds and I can't wait to tackle life with you. We have so much 
            potential together and we both refuse to let High-School be our peak and that's the 
            mindset we need as a couple to achieve all our goals. And we have some pretty crazy goals 
            let's be honest.
            <br><br>
            Your looks and your body. I'm going to make this the shortest paragraph cus you know how
            I feel about you. I make sure to tell you everytime I see you. Everytime I
            look at you, I just ajkhdakjslhdakljalkdhj.You make me so mad. You are so fucking 
            adorable and kajsgfasjfal,I sometimes can't believe I am with you. Enough said, moving 
            on... 
            <br><br>
            You are strong. You are very strong. You shouldn't have to be but you are. I look up to 
            you. You have been through more than I can imagine and you are still here, in your 
            amazing self showering me with love and affection. I have never felt truly lonely 
            with you and I notice the lengths you go to make me feel this way even when you have 
            so much going on. You think I don't see it but I know how painful it is for you to 
            wake up every morning and think about going to school, get a driver's license and the 100 
            other anxiety inducing things you have to do. I could never know what it feels like. 
            What it feels like to have to walls closing in on you like you do every day. And I am 
            here for you no matter what and we will take it at our own pace. We are our own 
            people and we do things our way. You should know that I am always once call away from 
            you no matter where I am in the world and I will come running to you just like you 
            will for me should anything happen. 
            <br><br>
            You are caring and thoughtful. This has especially to do with you and your family. You 
            are very responsible even if your family makes you feel otherwise and it is because
            you care for everyone around you is why it might feel like they take you for granted. 
            You are thoughtful because you care about how your sisters are perceived and how 
            you want them to grow up to be strong, responsible individuals. For the people that 
            don't notice this, it is their loss. I have always wanted a sibling and if I had 
            a sibling like you, I would be the proudest brother there ever was. I would rather 
            you push me and make me a better person, just like you do in our relationship than 
            simply not care and I am incredibly sorry for the situation you are in. I pray 
            things get better and you feel more welcome with your loved ones. 
            <br><br>
            All in all, you are amazing and you are all the things I wish to be. Every laugh, 
            every cry we share makes me that much more enamored with you and I can't wait to 
            spend the rest of my life with you. You're mine and I'm yours and I promise to become 
            a better person as I was this year. In fact, I promise to become better everyday than 
            I was the day before just so I can be a little closer to perfection for you. Thank you 
            for trusting me with your heart. You'll always have mine and I hope you will take good 
            care of it for me my love. 
            <br><br>
            Yours forever.<br>
